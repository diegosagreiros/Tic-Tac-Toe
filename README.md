# Tic-Tac-Toe
Basic version of this classic game built in HTML + CSS + Javascript

And just another step on my way to learn Web Development, I've put in practice a couple of things working on this excercise:

CSS: variables, pseudo-elements
Javascript: Use of array methods, DOM, conditional statements

It's not revolutionary, but definitely important for my learning.
